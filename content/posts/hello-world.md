# What?

I feel like starting a simple blog where I can write about projects I am working on, problems I run in to, and eventually the solutions to those problems. I will also be writing about any tips, tricks and cool tools I run in to throughout the process.

# Why?

To be honest, I do not expect anyone to be reading this at all. I just want some place to write about technology that excite and sometimes annoy me. If anyone wants to read this, that's great, but it really is not the main reason I am doing this.

# When?

I will be updating here whenever I run in to something cool or challenging.
